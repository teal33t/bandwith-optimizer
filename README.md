## Overview
A Flask application for managing Quality of Service (QoS) policies on network devices. Provides web-based interface for configuring and monitoring QoS settings.

### Architecture
The QoS Bandwidth Optimizer follows a modular architecture:

1. **Web Interface Layer**: Flask-based frontend with Flask-AppBuilder for admin interfaces
2. **Business Logic Layer**: Core QoS policy management and device interaction logic
3. **Device Communication Layer**: SSH and SNMP-based communication with network devices
4. **Data Persistence Layer**: SQLAlchemy ORM with database models for all QoS components

2. Login with admin credentials (default: admin/admin)
3. Add network devices using device credentials
4. Verify device connectivity (SSH, SNMP, ICMP)
5. Discover device interfaces

### QoS Configuration Workflow
1. Create traffic classes for your applications
2. Define class maps with match criteria
3. Create policy maps with QoS mechanisms
4. Apply policies to device interfaces
5. Verify policy application

### Monitoring
1. View real-time bandwidth statistics
2. Analyze historical usage patterns
3. Check for QoS policy effectiveness
4. Export reports for capacity planning

### Troubleshooting
1. Verify device connectivity status
2. Check interface statistics for errors
3. Review policy application logs
4. Validate QoS configuration on devices
